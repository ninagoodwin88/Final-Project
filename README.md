# City of Chicago Crime Precentages

## Selected Topic
### Analyzing crime data in Chicago based off of latitude and longtitude
- Using a variety of tools, we will view the precentage of arrests rates based on certain areas throughout and the city, and what age group is most likely to commit an be arrested for a violent crime in certain areas of the city.
## Reason for Selecting Topic
- I want to build an interactive page that will allow the user to enter their latitude and longitude coordinates and be able to view the violent crime percentages in the city of Chicago.
- This information can be used by the native Chicagoan or tourist to decide where to patronize any establishment or where to possibly purchase or invest in real estate in Chicago.

## Description of the Source Data
Websites referenced for data were:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Arrests/dpt3-jri9/data
https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/dataset/crime.html
- For the sake of our analysis, we will only use data from 2015-2020.
- These websites provide access to case numbers, arrests, crime descriptions, and latitude and longitude of committed crimes.


## Questions we hope to answer with the data
- What are the age groups that have the highest violent crime rate?
- In what location in the city of Chicago are violent crimes most likely to occur? 
- What are the percentages of violent crimes in Chicago?
