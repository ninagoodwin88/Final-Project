# Most Dangerous Wards in Chicago
Visual Studio, Postgres SQL, HTML

## Selected Topic
- Analyzing crime data in Chicago based off amount of arrests in different wards throughout the city of Chicago.

## Reason for Selecting Topic
- The project is to create a web page that will allow the user to see the most dangerous wards in the city of Chicago.
- This information can be used by the native Chicagoan or tourist to decide where to patronize any establishment or where to possibly purchase or invest in real estate in Chicago.
- Chicago PD will also be able to utilize the data to know which wards need a heavier police presence.

## Description of the Source Data
Websites referenced for data were:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Arrests/dpt3-jri9/data

## Questions we hope to answer with the data
- Given all these crimes which wards grouped together are dangerous?
- Which wards have the highest arrest rates.
